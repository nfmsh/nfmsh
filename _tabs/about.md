Welcome to Notes From My Smart Home, which is exactly that notes to help me set HASS up again if it dies completely and i somehow lose all backups.
Its also useful to help other set up their own or add stuff i've worked out.
So not a blog, im not an influencer but if i write a rambling post that helps you, then great, add a comment and let me know.
Just dont expect shiny articles and helpful video from me, unless i find one that helped me.
