Welcome to "Notes From My Smart Home". This isn't a tech blog or even a smart home blog, infact its not a blog at all. I'm not a tech blogger, creator or influencer. 
This is just a place for me to drop my notes on setting up certain integrations or creating templates within Home Assistant, then if i ever lose it entirely i have somewhere to look.
If that helps other do what i did then great, so dont expect reveiws, neatly written articles or fancy how to videos, just jumbled info dumps that may make sense to me but not necessarily to you.
